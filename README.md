Face recognition is a critical component of numerous applications, spanning security systems, mobile devices, and social media platforms. Traditional methods often demand extensive datasets for training, rendering them computationally intensive and less adaptable in scenarios with limited data. This project proposes a novel Face Recognition system employing One-Shot Learning, a technique tailored to discern facial similarities with minimal training data. Siamese neural networks are trained using both the Olivetti dataset and a custom dataset. To enhance robustness, training samples are processed to achieve uniform distribution. During testing  the system demonstrates promising performance, exhibiting an accuracy of approximately 80% amidst unseen faces with environmental and angle variations. Further optimization and rigorous evaluation are underway to bolster accuracy and ensure applicability across diverse real-world settings.
